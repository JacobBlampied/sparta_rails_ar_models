#Sparta Rails Model

##Description
The aim of this project is to use Ruby on Rails to generate an application where two databases are connected using Active Record Associations (in this case: one to many). The data must be validated before it is input into the database.

##Languages used
* Ruby on Rails

##How to download
Clone down the repositiory using the following console command:
git clone git@github.com:JacobBlampied/sparta_rails_ar_models.git

##Challenges
* Adding/removing columns once the database has already been created.
* Working through errors as new elements are added.
* Ran bundler command but could not get bootsrap and jQuery gems to install.

##Takeaways
* Achieved an understanding on how to set up new databases and process them through the different pages.
